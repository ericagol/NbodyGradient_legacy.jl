Overview
--------

universal.c is a fast, accurate Kepler solver in universal variables
that does not use the Stumpff series.  It takes as input a "Kepler
constant," a time step, and state pointers to the initial state and
the advanced state.

universal.c is intended to be used as part of an N-body integrator
such as those based on the Wisdom-Holman method and its variations.

Publication
-----------

universal.c is described in Wisdom and Hernandez (2015) MNRAS, in
press.

Compilation
-----------

To make the object file (universal.o) just type "make all" in the
directory with the sources.

The main files universal.h and universal.c are packaged in UNIVERSAL
with two sample programs that use them:  

(1) The first is called simple.c.  It take a single step using the
Kepler stepper.  After "make all" just type:
./simple
to see the results.  

(2) The program "test-universal.c" produces the data for the top panel
in Fig.3 in Wisdom and Hernandez (2015).  After "make all" just type:
./test-universal > universal.dat
The figure may be produced from this data by executing gnuplot:
gnuplot universal.gnuplot
